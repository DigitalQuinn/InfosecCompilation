<br>

* **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information that can be used to support targeting
  * Details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel
* **Resource Development:** Creating, purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting
  * Infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities
* **Initial Access:** Various entry vectors to gain your initial foothold within a network
  * Targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers
* **Execution:** Attacker-controlled code running on a local or remote system
  * Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data
* **Persistence:** Maintaining access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off adverdary's access
  * Aaccess, action, or configuration changes that allow attackers to maintain your
   foothold on systems
* **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher-level permissions on a system or network
* **Defense Evasion:** Avoiding detection throughout your compromise
  * Uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts, leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade your malware
* **Credential Access:** Stealing credentials like account names and passwords
  * Legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more accounts to help achieve your goals
* **Discovery:** Observing what they can control and what’s around your entry point in order to discover how it could benefit your current objective
* **Lateral Movement:** Pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain additional access
* **Collection:** Gathering information relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives
  * Frequently, the next goal after collecting data is to exfiltrate the data
* **Command & Control (C2):** Communicating with systems under your control within a victim network
  * Adversaries commonly attempt to mimic normal, expected traffic to avoid detection
* **Exfiltration:** Stealing data from victim's infrastructure
  * Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over your C2 channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission
* **Impact:** Disrupting availability, compromising integrity by manipulating business and operational processes
